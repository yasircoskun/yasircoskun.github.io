### HackerNews Comment System

Previously, I developed a project for my blog that integrates comments via `markdown` using the HackerNews Official API. However, the code of that project was too complex, actually the code of this blog page is a bit irregular. (Hope to edit soon)

I rewrote the project so that it can be used by others and is open for expansion. The project is still alpha version and I know the code is dirty. There are unused classes and poorly organized conceptual links. but I want to show my project and try it. I'm new to this platform and this is my first Show HN post.

now i will post this file on my github page and post the link of the post to 'Show HN', i will add HN post id to my blog page.

And we can see comments on my static web page. (if you write something)

#### How to add on my static pages?

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/yasircoskun/yasircoskun.github.io@v0.2.1.10-alpha-hnc/contents/projects/HackerNews_Comment_System/HackerNewsComments.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/yasircoskun/yasircoskun.github.io@v0.2.1.10-alpha-hnc/contents/projects/HackerNews_Comment_System/HackerNewsComments.css" />
<div id="CommentArea"></div>
```

```javascript
new HackerNewsComment("#CommentArea", 721); 
```

721 is a HN post id i use it for try.

```javascript
new HackerNewsComment("#CommentArea"); 
```

if your page published on HN you can use this without specify HN ID. it can find your HN post via [Algolia API](https://hn.algolia.com/api).

Here are some use examples in codepen:

- [Pure version](https://codepen.io/yasircoskun/pen/rNzXwJz) (this uses your page style, i use it on my page)
- [Matrix Theme](https://codepen.io/yasircoskun/pen/jOGNzqg)

I'll write more themes and want to add more customization options.

for now,
